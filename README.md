# EcoCharge: Battery Usage Prediction with Machine Learning ðŸš€ðŸ”‹

Predicts remaining battery time and suggests optimizations using ML on smartphone data.

## Features
âœ… Data preprocessing and cleaning  
âœ… Regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
âœ… Streamlit dashboard for displaying battery predictions  
âœ… Clean, structured code for learning and showcasing on GitHub
âœ… Upload your own CSV sensor dataset  
âœ… Predict remaining battery life using a trained model  
âœ… Visualize predictions using a live line chart  


## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook in `notebooks/` to train the model.
4. Run the dashboard:
```
streamlit run app/dashboard.py
```
## ðŸ“¸ Demo
